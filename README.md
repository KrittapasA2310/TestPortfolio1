Graph-Theoretic Portfolio Construction Using Centrality Measures
Project Summary
This project applies graph theory to portfolio management by modeling financial assets as a correlation-based network and using network centrality measures to guide portfolio allocation. Assets are represented as nodes, and relationships are derived from correlation-based distances. A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is used to extract the core market structure, and rolling centrality measures are used to dynamically rebalance portfolios.
The goal is to evaluate whether centrality-based allocation improves risk-adjusted performance relative to a rolling equal-weight benchmark.
